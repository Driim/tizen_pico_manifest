Different branches of manifest git are mapped to different version of Tizen:

=========   ================

tizen_2.1   2.2
tizen       3.0

Main manifest files for different branches(Versions)
----------------------------------------------------

Tizen 2.1 and Tizen 2.2
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Tizen 2.1 and Tizen 2.2 have the same manifest structure:

- _metadata.xml:

  meta packages including image-configuation, package-groups, build-config and gbs-config

- _prebuilt-{i586, arm}.xml:

  pre-built binary toolchain related packages, which are used for local full buuild

- _projects.xml:

  different groups of packages

There's only no profile special manifest file in Tizen 2.1 and Tizen 2.2,
only common (default.xml) exists.

Tizen 3.0
'''''''''

IVI, Mobile and Common profiles are supportted in Tizen 3.0.

ivi.xml: main index file for ivi profile
mobile.xml: main index file for mobile profile
common.xml: main index file for common profile

Different profiles have its' different package list and pre-builts, as there's no
common packages are shared, so packages list must be maintained individually.

Basic Usage::
    $  repo init -u <url> -b tizen -m ivi.xml
    $  repo init -u <url> -b tizen -m mobile.xml

Update manifests for Tizen 3.0
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The manifest maintained in scm/manifest project is the combination about all
manfiests of each profile(common/mobile).

The script check_manifest.py is working for updating manifest, after 'repo init'
above.
The script will download the latest manifests from latest snapshot repo,
then make a diff between the local manifests(from review.tizen.org) and latest
ones.
If there are any updates, check them by git-diff under .repo/manfiest dir and
submit to remote if needed.

Basic Usage::
    $ check_manifest.py --tizen-src . -p <profile> --url <profile-latest> --update

Example::
    $ check_manifest.py --tizen-src . -p mobile --url mobile-latest --update

Notes
'''''

During update, the script will get all branches of updated packages from
review.tizen.org, so the usrname and passwd for loggging in are needed to fill
first:

::

  171 gc = GerritClient('https://review.tizen.org/gerrit', '<usrname>', '<passwd>')
